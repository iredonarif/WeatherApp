# About
This is a simple NodeJs app providing weather information for a given city.
This app runs only on console and the main file is app.js.

The program shows an input that ask the user to enter a city name (or a list of cities).
Once the input has been validated by the user, the program displays line by line, the weather information for each city.

## Note
The goal was to learn how to handle http request with nodejs. And to go faster i used a free api online.

This application is based on an example of a small project with Nodejs on the youtube channel "LES TEACHERS DU NET"
